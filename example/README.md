# ng-board example
### on how things could be done

Just `bower i` and `npm i` and then `node server.js`.

In this case it is using [dispatcher.io](https://github.com/leostera/dispatcher.io) with [it's ng-board transport](https://github.com/leostera/dispatcher.io-ng-board) to both serve the dashboard and to pipe data to it.
