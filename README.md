# ng-board
### a realtime angular dashboard

This is a really simple project that aims to push forward the AngularJS community towards creating a better realtime dashboard platform.

Creating widgets for it is really simple and using the built-in $io service it's dead easy to talk with any websockets server.

We use [transporter.io](https://github.com/leostera/transporter.io) with it's [ng-board transport](https://github.com/leostera/transporter.io-ng-board) but you can use whatever you want in the background.

### Widgets

Sneak a peak in any of the `ng-board-*` repositories in this list to see how easy you can get started by making your own widgets or using existing ones:

* [ng-board-linker](https://github.com/leostera/ng-board-linker): An easy way to use the message data. Serves as a basic example.

* [ng-board-smoothie](https://github.com/leostera/ng-board-smoothie): fancier charts for the people looking for vivid widgets.

* [ng-board-list](https://github.com/danielyoung/ng-board-list): a configurable list of items, ideal for streaming things (like tweets or virtually anything you see fit).

### Contributing

Go ahead, fork this repo or any of the widgets or make your own from scratch! Make it available on Bower or Component and share it with us to include it in this readme.
